# Database Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack database management system developed as part of the Database course at Birzeit University. It efficiently stores, retrieves, and manages structured data while ensuring data integrity and optimized querying. The system features dynamic content display, user authentication, and a shopping cart functionality.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and account creation, with user data stored in the database.
- **Dynamic Product Display**: The homepage dynamically showcases three products from each category stored in the database.
- **Category Browsing**: Clicking on a product or category reveals detailed product listings fetched directly from the database.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can adjust quantities or remove products, and cart data is stored in the database. After payment, the cart is cleared, and product quantities are updated.
- **Profile Page**: Editable user data, detailed statistics (daily, monthly, and yearly purchases), and a pie chart showing category purchase percentages.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different interfaces and permissions for customers, employees, and managers.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations implemented across various modules.
- **Optimized Queries**: Improved database performance with optimized SQL queries.
- **Data Validation & Integrity**: Ensures reliable data handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Backend**: PHP, JavaScript
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbdalhameedMaree/DataBase-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd DataBase-Project
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   - Import the provided `.sql` file into MySQL.
   - Configure database credentials in the PHP configuration file.
4. Start the project:
   - Deploy the project on a local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
   - Ensure Apache and MySQL services are running.

## Usage
- Access the system via `http://localhost/your_project_folder`.
- Use the provided interface to interact with the database.
- Perform CRUD operations through the web application.

## Learning Experience
- **PHP & JavaScript**: Learned and implemented in just three days.
- **HTML & CSS**: Revisited and strengthened knowledge.
- **SQL**: Learned through the course to design and manage the database effectively.

## PS
- The ER Diagram has been modified slightly, but this is the best available version.
- The website must be run using a local server for full functionality.
- To see a demo of the website, check my LinkedIn post: [View Here](https://shorturl.at/dgufV).
- Some images used in the website were lost, but replacements will be added soon.
- Extract the code file before running the project.
